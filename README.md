- What's up, I'm Xander, or xandermander46. This is my profile and how I will be documenting my journey to become a game designer.
- I've loved games for as long as I remember but never thought about creating them. The closest I would get to 
dreaming of becoming a game designer would be the passing thoughts of "wouldn't it be cool to make them? Nah". But as I experience more of the potential that 
the medium of games offer and learned critical thinking skills, the stray notions became something to achieve. And now I'm here trying to make it achievable.
